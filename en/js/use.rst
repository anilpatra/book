Using on()
**********

So far we only looked into :php:meth:`AbstractView::js`. There is another
method, which might be easier to use::

    $view->on('click')->action();
    $view->on('click', $view2->js()->action());

    $view->on('click', 'selector')->action();
    $view->on('click', 'selector', $view->js()->action());

Do not use chain returned by on() in other chains.

Using on() with selector
========================

Example::

    $form = $this->add('Form');
    $form->addField('john');
    $form->addField('smith');

    $form->on('focus', 'input')->css([ 'background' => 'red']);
    $form->on('blur',  'input')->css([ 'background' => '']);

Using with PHP callback
=======================

On also accepts callable argument, so you can actually pass a PHP call-back::

    $form->on('focus', 'input', function($js) {
        $js->val(rand(1,100));
    });

Above example will fill fields with random numbers when you click in them. The
callback method receives 2 arguments. First ($js) is the chain which selects
affected element, in our case - input field.

Receiving JS data in PHP callback
=================================

The other argument is data() of that element. jQuery implements $.data()
for associtaing JavaScript properties with the field.

Data is automatically passed and you can set it back using data method.
Here is a new implementation, which increases value of the field and stores
it in data()::

    $form->on('focus', 'input', function($js, $data) {
        $c=$data['cnt']+1;
        $js->val($c)->data('cnt', $c);
    });

The functionality of on() PHP callback is implemented using a VirtualPage.

.. _reloading:

**************
View Reloading
**************

Each page of Agile Toolkit can use :php:method:`App_Web::url` to determine
it's URL location. JavaScript does not have knowledge of a current page.

A method :php:meth:`jQuery_Chain::reload` is a PHP-based method which produces
a JavaScript code for reloading a view::

    $grid->addButton('Reload')->js('click', $grid->js()->reload());

Although this seems like a regular JS Chain, reload() will actually pass an
URL of current page (including :ref:`Sticky GET`) and cut options (See :ref:`cutting`)
for object reloading.

This method should be used for dynamically changing part of your page. The above
example would make $grid reload when the button is clicked. Remember that
Agile Toolkit takes care of re-binding the events for the reloaded part of the
page, so in the above case the "reload" click event will automatically be
re-assigned after grid (including a button) is reloaded.

Method ``reload()`` takes several arguments, but I'll only describe the
first one. It's an optional array with extra GET arguments which the page will
recieve. Example::

    $grid->addButton('Filter Girls')->js('click', $grid->js()->reload(['gender'=>'F']));
    $grid->addButton('Filter Boys')->js('click', $grid->js()->reload(['gender'=>'M']));

    if($this->app->stickyGET('gender')){
        $grid->model->addCondition('gender', $_GET['gender']);
    }

This example now adds 2 buttons. Both button will reload the grid, but they would pass
an extra GET argument to the AJAX request (gender). Below we want to add condition
to the grid, if the gender is present.

User will never see this argument in the URL of his browser, because it's passed
in through AJAX reload. We do need to make this argument sticky, because Grid
may contain paginatior and we don't want it to forget the condition.

Off-page reload.
================

Sometimes the original object is not available to call a reload(). Assuming
you have two pages::

    // Page1
    $grid = $this->add('Grid');

    $this->add('Button')->js('click')->univ()->dialogURL($this->app->url('page2'));


    // Page2
    $b2 = $this->add('Button')->set('Reload Grid');

Although two pages are displayed on the same physical page (second page is in dialog),
the $b2 object cannot reference $grid. This can be fixed like this:

1. Add a custom event for grid reloading.
2. Add some class on a grid for easier selecting
3. On page 2 use selector and trigger your custom event.

Resulting code::

    // Page1
    $grid = $this->add('Grid');
    $grid->addClass('do-reload');
    $grid->js('reload')->reload();

    $this->add('Button')->js('click')->univ()->dialogURL($this->app->url('page2'));


    // Page2
    $b2 = $this->add('Button')->set('Reload Grid');
    $b2->js('click', $this->js()->_selector('.do-reload')->trigger('reload'));



.. _url component array:

*******************
URL Component Array
*******************

All the methods in Agile Toolkit which accept URL, can also accetp URL component
array. Suppose you have a div on your page and a button::

    $f = $this->add('Form',null,null,['form/compact']);
    $f_name = $f->addField('name');
    $f_surname = $f->addField('surname');

    $b = $this->add('Button')->set('Load data');

    $d = $this->add('View');

    $b->js('click', $d->js()->atk_load($this->api->page('mypage')));

When you click on the button it will load the contens of the page inside View.
See also :ref:`Cutting` for more information about partial page loads.

To use URL component array, first surround the URL you pass to atk_load with
brackets::

    $b->js('click', $d->js()->atk_load( [ $this->api->page('mypage')) ] );

Then you can add additional arguments to this array::

    $b->js('click', $d->js()->atk_load( [
        $this->api->page('mypage')),
        'name' => 'John',
        'surname' => 'Smith',
    ] );


This will pass the 2 GET arguments to "mypage" with specified values. However
we can also use JavaScript expressions with URL Comonent Array to automatically
pull value of our fields::

    $b->js('click', $d->js()->atk_load( [
        $this->api->page('mypage')),
        'name' => $f_name->js()->val(),
        'surname' => $f_surname->js()->val()
    ] );

Now you can pass values from the page on a button-click.
